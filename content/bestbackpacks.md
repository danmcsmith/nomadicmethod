As more adventurers hit the road for traveling, the more options we have for luggage. Travel backpacks are the best option for frequent travel abroad. From the weekend warrior to the long-term nomad, backpacks beat wheeled luggage any day. 

Best of travel backpacks are chosen based on specific user and quality. It’s easy to find a cheap pack but when traveling long term and for safety, it is a good idea to invest in a quality pack. Which quality pack depends on your preference. We recommend minimal to moderate packing. With that in mind, these packs range from 45L to 65L, depending on how much you want to travel with.

The best of 2019 list is not sourced by affiliate partners but handpicked by nomads.
