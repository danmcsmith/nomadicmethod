For over 5 years, I've dedicated my pursuits to travel planning, budgeting, and breaking down my own barriers to travel. I've discovered financial strategies to saving to travel and staying abroad as well as disproved travel myths that kept me from taking a leap to board the one-way flight out of my comfort zone. 

The purpose of Nomadic Method is to get you out of stagnation and into your travel dream. From financial tips to overcoming self-doubts, this is the source of how to go from your desk job to beach hopping around the world. Not just a vacation but 1 year or more! Maybe drop the dull and roam the world as a nomad. Travel is the catalyst for change. Personal growth is exponential while on the road. It's your turn to see what you become.
